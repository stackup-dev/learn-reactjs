        "content":"I started my programming journey when I was in secondary school. Back then, I joined an Infocomm club and I started to learn Scratch, a versatile drag-and-drop tool that teaches me simple logic flow, data conditioning and simple iteration loops. It got me so interested in programming that I spent hours making a flight simulator on Scratch.\n\nI was so into programming that I took the computing class for my GCE O Levels. There, I started learning my first real programming language and that was Python. I was learning data structuring, the basics of networking, functions and classes and much more. My computing teacher gave my classes a series of programming questions in a gamified manner. Each time we got an algorithm correct, we were awarded points. My friends and I will spend time after school trying to outdo each other.\n\nWith the experience I had, and the opportunities I was given, I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I am currently in my 3rd year and I am looking forward to my final year project and internship opportunities.",

        "content":"I first started my StackUp journey on 15 March 2022. I remember my first quest was on Rust, which was rather difficult for me. But by reading the documentation carefully and asking for help on the Discord server, I was able to understand the syntax and code. Today, I enjoy the web development quests very much as it helps me in my journey to become a full-stack web developer. At the same time, I enjoy the huge campaigns where we get to learn about different blockchain protocols like Avalanche and Algorand. ",
